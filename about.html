	  			<h3><center>What This Is</center></h3>

	  			<hr / class="style">

	  			<p>Hi, my name is Cade Stombaugh and this is where I am bringing my love of the outdoors and tech, along with my growing affintity for coding, together into one little digital playground.	This is where I bring together the things that I love. I have also felt pulled between two seemingly contradictory worlds, the great outdoors and tech.</p>

	  			<p>I plan to document my journey learning to code and the fun little ideas that pop into my head. Anything from fun gadgets to outdoor equipment and destinations. </p>

	  			<h3><center>A Little About the Man</center></h3>
	  			<hr / class="style">
	  			<p>I am a 30-something guy, with a beautiful wife and 2 boys that keep me on my toes. I just passed the  8 year mark of my military career which I am hoping to transition out of using this wonderful new skill set I'm working on. I really enjoy being active if that wasn't already clear. I consider myself a runner and general athlete though I really just do it for fun and stress relief (something that I am in constant need of it seems). I also really enjoy reading a large variety of different topics and themes. Self-labeled Harry Potter nerd, but I love non-fiction as well.</p>

	  			<p>I am a essentially a Helicopter Electrician, but as things are in the US Coast Guard, I wear many hats from Flight Mechanic to Health Promotions Coordinator. I have really enjoyed my time in the USCG but it is time for me and my family to move on and try something different.</p>

	  			<p>I grew up in Central Illinois, where I got my B.S. in Psychology from Illinois State. Not making much use of that degree these days though. Illinois being where our family remains means that is where we would like to move back to from Florida where we are currently stationed. After living in 5 different states in 8 years, I'm ready to stop uprooting my family every few years.</p>

	  			<p>Coding has given my a technical hobby that also allows me to be creative, things I don't really think you get to combine in most fields. It also gives me "reason" to play with new toys :). This is one of those things I always saw other people do and thought to myself, "Huh, now that's pretty cool. Wish I could do something like that." I never stopped to realize that, "...wait, why can't I do something like that?" So I decided to stop thinking it could be cool and find out for myself. And with that, here I am, and here this is.</p>

	  			<p>So, welcome to my digital playground. Have fun looking around and never hestitate to reach out and say "hey".</p>
